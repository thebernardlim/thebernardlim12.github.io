# Azure Data Engineer Associate Certification Guide

## Strategy

### Step 1 - Download & Print the 'Exam Skills Outline' document

With any certification, I will usually first download the 'Skills Measured' document from the official Microsoft certification page which will enlist the technologies and its aspects it will test upon.

- [DP-200 Exam Outline](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE3Vzx2)
- [DP-201 Exam Outline](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE3VRMb)

*Note: Microsoft regularly updates its exam syllabus hence it is very important to check the official pages for announcements on exam changes / retirements etc.*

Below are the official exam pages links:
- [DP-200 Exam Page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/dp-200) 
- [DP-201 Exam Page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/dp-201)

I will usually paste the contents into an Excel spreadsheet and print it out as a simple checklist I can refer to and easily visualized.

### Step 2 - Studying with Microsoft Learn

For both these exams, there is a prepared **Microsoft Learn** guide already prepared by the folks at Microsoft
- [Microsoft Learn ](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RWuAzL)

I personally think this is the best introductory study material as it is well-structured and friendly to someone new to the technologies. It comes with prepared labs, sandboxes, properly arranged topics, quizzes and also an element of gamification so things are not so dry.

While learning, I will usually take notes for key points or questions that I think will be useful for future easy revision/further research.

I have also uploaded some of my [study notes](https://thebernardlim.github.io/certification/2020/01/28/dp-200-exam-guide/) which may of help.

### Step 3 - Reading further with Microsoft Docs
